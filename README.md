<h1>This is an example code of Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions(DPOAE) noise reduction by Power Spectral Density(PSD).<br>
</h1> 

<h2>#Written by Sheng-Lun, Kao</h2> 

<h3>How to run?</h3> 
<p>
put folder "DPOAE_Data" in C:\   ,then open the code (DPOAE_c_noise reduction_PSD.ipynb) by Jupyter Notebook, run it.

### [PSD noise reduction]
### - recorded in quiet 34dBA
We hope PSD noise reduction (green line) as close as possible to the baseline(black line, record DPOAE in quiet), the closer the better.

### - recorded in 70 dBA white noise
record DPOAE in noisy (red line)

### - recorded in 75 dBA white noise
record DPOAE in noisy (red line)
